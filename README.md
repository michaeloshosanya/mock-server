# Mock Server

## Overview
The package was created with testing in mind - don't run this in prod :(

Your application's code will always execute in the exact same way given:
1. The code don't change
2. Your input is the same
3. There are no external factors influencing your code.

Well, in real life, our applications are connected and dependent on so many external factors, like
database, message brokers, caching, or external APIs. These are the factors this package is trying
to address by providing an easy way of mocking these services with out have to bring up an instance of 
this service.

Enough blabbering.
